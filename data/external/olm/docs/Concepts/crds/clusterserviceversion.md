A ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) represents a particular version of a running operator on a cluster. It includes metadata such as name, description, version, repository link, labels, icon, etc. It declares `owned`/`required` CRDs, cluster requirements, and install strategy that tells OLM how to create required resources and set up the operator as a [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

OLM requires you to provide metadata about your operator in order to ensure that it can be kept running safely on a cluster, and to provide information about how updates should be applied as you publish new versions of your operator.

This is very similar to packaging software for a traditional operating system - think of the packaging step for OLM as the stage at which you make your `rpm`, `deb`, or `apk` bundle.

## Writing your Operator Manifests

OLM uses an api called `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) to describe a single instance of a version of an operator. This is the main entrypoint for packaging an operator for OLM.

There are two important ways to think about the CSV:

1. Like an `rpm` or `deb`, it collects metadata about the operator that is required to install it onto the cluster.
2. Like a `Deployment` that can stamp out `Pod`s from a template, the `ClusterServiceVersion` describes a template for the operator `Deployment` and can stamp them out.

This is all in service of ensuring that when a user installs an operator from OLM, they can understand what changes are happening to the cluster, and OLM can ensure that installing the operator is a safe operation.
